# TA-barracuda-NGX

Author: Guilhem Marchand

This Technology Addon provides index time parsing and search time extractions (CIM mapping) for the barracuda NGX firewalls

See:
https://community.barracudanetworks.com/forum/index.php?/topic/27286-syslog-message-format/

Barracuda data will ingested as syslog data, the strongly recommended approach is using a syslog receiver (rsyslog, syslog-ng), and having
Splunk with UF deployment monitoring the log files.
Otherwise, Splunk can act as the syslog receiver, but this approach has various limitations compared to the much more robust receiver deployment

Barracuda firewalls will essentially provide 2 formats for the syslog data:

- An header less mode where "|" is used as the delimiter, use the sourcetype "barracuda_ngx_raw" when designing your inputs
- A Key / Value mode, very convenient for Splunk and easier to read for humans, use the sourcetype "barracuda_ngx_kv" when designing your inputs

Deploy this TA to:

- Indexers (standalone or clustered)
- Search Heads
- Intermediate Heavy Forwarders, if any
- Heavy Forwarder if used to monitor the syslog log files generated by the syslog receiver
- Heavy Forwarder if used to act as a Splunk syslog receiver (not recommended)
